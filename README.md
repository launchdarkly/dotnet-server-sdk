The LaunchDarkly Server-Side SDK for .NET is designed primarily for use in multi-user systems such as web servers and applications. It follows the server-side LaunchDarkly model for multi-user contexts. It is not intended for use in desktop and embedded systems applications.

For using LaunchDarkly in *client-side* .NET applications, including mobile (Xamarin) applications and desktop applications, refer to our [Xamarin SDK](https://github.com/launchdarkly/xamarin-client-sdk).

## LaunchDarkly overview

## Supported .NET versions

This version of the SDK is built for the following targets:

* .NET 6.0: runs on .NET 6.0 and above (including higher major versions).
* .NET Core 3.1: runs on .NET Core 3.1+.
* .NET Framework 4.6.2: runs on .NET Framework 4.6.2 and above.
* .NET Standard 2.0: runs in any project that is targeted to .NET Standard 2.x rather than to a specific runtime platform.

The .NET build tools should automatically load the most appropriate build of the SDK for whatever platform your application or library is targeted to.

The only differences in the SDK between platforms are these:

* Setting a TCP connection timeout is only supported in .NET Core and .NET 6.0+. For more details, see `HttpConfigurationBuilder.ConnectTimeout`.
* The SDK requires the `System.Text.Json` API to be available; it is built into the standard runtime library in .NET Core and .NET 6.0+, but not on other platforms, so on other platforms the SDK brings in `System.Text.Json` as a NuGet package dependency.

## Getting started

Refer to the [SDK documentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/server-side/dotnet#getting-started) for instructions on getting started with using the SDK.

## Signing

The published version of this assembly is digitally signed with Authenticode and [strong-named](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/app-domains/strong-named-assemblies). Building the code locally in the default Debug configuration does not use strong-naming and does not require a key file. The public key file is in this repository at `LaunchDarkly.pk` as well as here:

Read our [documentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com) for in-depth instructions on configuring and using LaunchDarkly. You can also head straight to the [complete reference guide for this SDK](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/server-side/dotnet).

The authoritative description of all types, properties, and methods is in the [generated API documentation](https://launchdarkly.github.io/dotnet-server-sdk/).

## Testing
 
We run integration tests for all our SDKs using a centralized test harness. This approach gives us the ability to test for consistency across SDKs, as well as test networking behavior in a long-running application. These tests cover each method in the SDK, and verify that event sending, flag evaluation, stream reconnection, and other aspects of the SDK all behave correctly.
 
## Contributing
 
We encourage pull requests and other contributions from the community. Check out our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on how to contribute to this SDK.

## About LaunchDarkly
 
* LaunchDarkly is a continuous delivery platform that provides feature flags as a service and allows developers to iterate quickly and safely. We allow you to easily flag your features and manage them from the LaunchDarkly dashboard.  With LaunchDarkly, you can:
    * Roll out a new feature to a subset of your users (like a group of users who opt-in to a beta tester group), gathering feedback and bug reports from real-world use cases.
    * Gradually roll out a feature to an increasing percentage of users, and track the effect that the feature has on key metrics (for instance, how likely is a user to complete a purchase if they have feature A versus feature B?).
    * Turn off a feature that you realize is causing performance problems in production, without needing to re-deploy, or even restart the application with a changed configuration file.
    * Grant access to certain features based on user attributes, like payment plan (eg: users on the ‘gold’ plan get access to more features than users in the ‘silver’ plan). Disable parts of your application to facilitate maintenance, without taking everything offline.
* LaunchDarkly provides feature flag SDKs for a wide variety of languages and technologies. Read [our documentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk) for a complete list.
