Tools for configuring how the SDK connects to LaunchDarkly, or to other software components.

This package contains the configuration builders for standard SDK components such as <xref:LaunchDarkly.Sdk.Server.Integrations.StreamingDataSourceBuilder>; the <xref:LaunchDarkly.Sdk.Server.Integrations.PersistentDataStoreBuilder> builder for use with database integrations (the specific database integrations themselves are provided by add-on libraries); and the test fixtures <xref:LaunchDarkly.Sdk.Server.Integrations.FileData> and <xref:LaunchDarkly.Sdk.Server.Integrations.TestData>.
