The base namespace for all LaunchDarkly .NET-based SDKs, containing common types.

Types in this namespace are part of the overall LaunchDarkly model, shared by both server-side and client-side SDKs. The one you will use most often is **<xref:LaunchDarkly.Sdk.User>**.

The NuGet package containing these types is [`LaunchDarkly.CommonSdk`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LaunchDarkly.CommonSdk). Normally you should not need to reference that package directly; it is loaded automatically as a dependency of the main SDK package.
