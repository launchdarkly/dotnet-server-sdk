    /// The SDK will also provide its own caching layer on top of the persistent data

    /// placeholder (tombstone) for a deleted item. There are two approaches a persistent store
    /// implementation can use for persisting this data:

    /// <item><description>
    /// Preferably, it should store the version number and the <see cref="SerializedItemDescriptor.Deleted"/>
    /// state separately so that the object does not need to be fully deserialized to read
    /// them. In this case, deleted item placeholders can ignore the value of
    /// <see cref="SerializedItemDescriptor.SerializedItem"/> on writes and can set it to
    /// null on reads. The store should never call <see cref="DataKind.Deserialize(string)"/>
    /// or <see cref="DataKind.Serialize(ItemDescriptor)"/> in this case.
    /// </description></item>
    /// <item><description>
    /// If that isn't possible, then the store should simply persist the exact string from
    /// <see cref="SerializedItemDescriptor.SerializedItem"/> on writes, and return the persisted
    /// string on reads -- setting <see cref="SerializedItemDescriptor.Version"/> to zero and
    /// <see cref="SerializedItemDescriptor.Deleted"/> to false. The string is guaranteed to
    /// provide the SDK with enough information to infer the version and the deleted state.
    /// On updates, the store will have to call <see cref="DataKind.Deserialize(string)"/> in
    /// order to inspect the version number of the existing item if any.

    /// error, or is otherwise unable to complete its task, it should throw an exception to make
    /// the SDK aware of this. The SDK will log the exception and will assume that the data store
