# Note that for projects that support older versions of .NET Standard, we usually run the regular
# CI tests for netcoreapp1.1 as well as netcoreapp2.0. But 1.1 is not available by default on the
# CircleCI host, and we can assume that we've already done the usual CI tests before a release -
# this is just a quick sanity check, so we can just run 2.0.
